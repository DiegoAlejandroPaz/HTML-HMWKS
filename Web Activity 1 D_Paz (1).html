<h1 style="background-color:tomato; text-align:center;">Rustic Lamb Pasta Bake</h1>
<b><i>Recipe by:Ayesha Curry</b></i>
<hr>
 
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the baking dish</br>
<br>2 medium onions, diced</br>
<br>2 tablespoons minced garlic</br>
<br>2 pounds ground lamb</br>
<br>1 tablespoon kosher salt</br>
<br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</br>
<br>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</br>
<br>1 teaspoon dried oregano</br>
<br>1 (24-ounce) jar marinara sauce</br>
<br>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</br>
<br>1½ pounds short dry pasta of your choice (such as rigatoni, fusilli, or penne)</br>
<br>1 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped</br>
<br>1 (15-ounce) container whole-milk ricotta</br>
<br>2 cups grated Parmigiano- Reggiano</br>
</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

In a deep skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the lamb, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and oregano and cook, stirring and breaking up the chunks of lamb, until the meat is no longer pink, about 7 minutes.

Reduce the heat to medium, stir in the marinara sauce and tomato sauce, and mix to combine. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.

Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes less than directed on the package. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Return the pasta to the pot, add the meat sauce and half of the reserved pasta water, and stir to mix. Stir in the basil, and add more of the pasta cooking liquid as needed so the sauce coats the pasta.

Transfer to a greased 8- by 11-inch glass or ceramic baking dish and dollop the ricotta over the top, spacing it evenly and pressing the ricotta down slightly into the pasta. Sprinkle the Parmigiano over the top. Bake for 25 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown. Serve hot.
